Data Abstraction

A methodology by which functions enforce an abstraction barrier between represenation and use

Parts of program that                Treat rationals as           Using

1. Implement selectors and 	     two-element lists   list literals and element selection
   constructor for rationals

2.  Create rationals or implement      numerators and denominators    rational, numer, denom
    rational operations

3.  Use rational numbers to preform    whole data values        add_rational, multi_rational
    computation                                                     rationals_are_equal,    


What is Data?

   Constructor and Selector functions work together to specify the right behavior

   Behavior condition: x= rational(n, d) then numer(x)/denom(x) must equal n/d

   Data abstraction uses selectors and constructors to define behavior

   If behavior conditions are met, then the represenation is valid
