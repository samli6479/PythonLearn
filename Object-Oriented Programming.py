# Object-Oriented Programming

''' 
A method for organizaing programs

- Data abstraction

- Building together information and related behavior

A metaphor for computation using distributed state

- Each object has its own local state

- Each onject also knows how to manage its own local state, based on method calls

- Method calls are messages passed between objects

- Several objects may all be same instances of common type

- Different types may relate to each other'''

# Classes- A class serves as template for its instances

# Idea: All banks hava a balance and an account holder

#       All bank accounts should have withdraw and deposit behaviors that work in the same 

# Better idea Share the withdraw and deposit method
