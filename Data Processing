Data Processing

Processing Sequential Data

Ex. The postive integers

The sequence interface we used before does not always apply

- A sequence has a finite, known length

- A sequence allows selection for any element

Big Data Processing:

- Implicit representations of streams of sequential data

- Declarative Programming lanuages to manipulated and transform data

- Distributed computing

Implicit Sequences

An implicit sequence is a representation of sequential data that does not explicitly store each element

ex. built-in range class

   range two values: start and end

   The length and element are computed on demand

   Constant memory for arbitary long sequence 

   Constant space for ar
