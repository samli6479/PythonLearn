Data Abstraction

A methodology by which functions enforce an abstraction barrier between represenation and use

Parts of program that                Treat rationals as           Using

1. Implement selectors and 	     two-element lists   list literals and element selection
   constructor for object

2.  Create object or implement      numerators and denominators    rational, numer, denom
   object operations

3.  Use object to preform           whole data values        add_rational, multi_rational
    action                                                     rationals_are_equal,    


What is Data?

   Constructor and Selector functions work together to specify the right behavior

   Behavior condition: x= rational(n, d) then numer(x)/denom(x) must equal n/d

   Data ab
