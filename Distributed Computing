Unix

Computer System

Systems research enables application development by defining and implementing abstractions:

  Operating Systems provide a stable, consistent interface to unreliable hardware

  Networds provide a robust data transfer interface communications infrastructure
  
  Databases rpovide a declarative interface to complex software and store information

  Distributed systems provide a unified interface to cluster of multiple machines

A unifying property of effective systems;
  
  Hide Complexity, but retain flexibility

Unix Operating System

- Protability: The same operating system on different hardware
- Multi-Tasking: Many processes run concurrently on a machine
- Plain Text: Data is stored and shared in text format
- Modularity: Small tools are composed flexibly via pipes

standard inputs ->process :-standard error -> standard output

Standard streams similar to Python iterators

Python Programs in Unix Environment

Built-in iput reads a line from standard input, print function write a line to standard output

sys.stdin and sys.stdout values provide access to the Unix Standard Stream as files
